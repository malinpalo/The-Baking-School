# The Baking School
The Baking School Website is a plattform for people who are curiose about how to bake, that never have baked, that might think that baking is difficult and boring.

The Baking School offers classes in easy and fun baking.<br> 
In a typicall class the teacher gives the student a easy recipe, tools like ingridients and kitchen utensils, a walktrough of the recipe. Then the student gets to bake with assistance of the teacher.

Users of the website will get all the information they need about the school, how to sign up and how to contact the school.

The aim of the project is to build a responsive website using HTML and CSS.
